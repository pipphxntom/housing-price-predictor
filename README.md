# 🏡 Housing Price Predictor

Predict housing prices based on features like area, number of rooms, neighborhood, and construction year using machine learning.  
This project uses data cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), feature engineering, and Random Forest Regression to build an accurate prediction model.

## 🚀 Project Overview
1. **Problem**: Predict house sale prices based on several features.
2. **Dataset**: Contains SquareFeet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Neighborhood, YearBuilt, and Price.
3. **Approach**:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - EDA with 7 different visualizations
   - Feature scaling and encoding
   - Model training using Random Forest Regressor
   - Saving the final model for future deployment
